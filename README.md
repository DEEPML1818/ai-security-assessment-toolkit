# AI Red Team Framework

A comprehensive framework for testing AI language models for vulnerabilities, bias, and security issues.

## What This Does

This framework systematically tests AI models across three key areas:

**üé≠ Fairness & Bias Testing**
- Tests for discriminatory responses based on gender, race, age, and other protected characteristics
- Compares model responses to neutral vs. targeted prompts
- Identifies potential bias in employment, capability attribution, and decision-making scenarios

**‚öîÔ∏è Adversarial Robustness Testing**
- Tests how well models handle modified inputs (character substitution, word reordering)
- Evaluates consistency when faced with adversarial prompts
- Measures semantic drift under various attack methods

**üîí Privacy Protection Testing**
- Tests if models inappropriately store or leak personal information (PII)
- Attempts to extract sensitive data from previous conversations
- Evaluates privacy-aware response patterns

## How It Works

1. **Runs automated tests** against your AI model using Google's Gemini API
2. **Analyzes responses** using bias detection algorithms and robustness metrics  
3. **Generates detailed reports** with vulnerability findings and risk assessments
4. **Provides actionable recommendations** for improving model safety

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from ai_redteam_framework import AIRedTeamFramework

async def main():
    red_team = AIRedTeamFramework(api_key="your_gemini_api_key")
    await red_team.run_full_red_team_assessment()
    red_team.print_executive_summary()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Google Gemini API key
- `pip install google-generativeai numpy`

## Output

The framework produces:
- Executive summary with overall risk assessment
- Detailed vulnerability reports in JSON format
- Specific examples of problematic model responses
- Recommendations for addressing identified issues

Perfect for organizations that need to validate AI model safety before deployment or ensure ongoing compliance with AI ethics guidelines.
